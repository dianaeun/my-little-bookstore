# My Little Bookstore

## Problem Statement 
People like to read books for personal growth, education, and entertainment. For people who love books, it is always a joy to buy books and create a collection of their favorite books. Nevertheless, it is not easy to determine whether a book is a perfect fit unless you read it through. These books that are purchased but do not belong to are nothing but problems since they collect dust while taking space. Simply throwing them out can be an option, but it is heart-breaking since you are a book lover, and after
all, they might work out for someone else. If you knew someone interested in those books, you might gladly hand them over. However, it is unlikely to find such a person among your friends.

## Solution
As a solution, our team suggests “My Little Bookstore,” a web application that aims to create a community by allowing users to upload the books they would like to sell and hand them over in person. People will also be able to view information about books provided by other users to help make the right decision. Our customers include anyone who loves or cares about books and also those looking for specific second-hand books. We want to provide a variety of services to support their reading experience.
