# My Little Bookstore

Problem Statement:  
For people who love books, it is always a great joy to buy books and create a collection of favorite books. However, it is not easy to determine whether this book is a perfect fit unless you read the whole book. These books that are bought but do not belong to are nothing but a problem since they collect dust while taking space. Simply throwing them out as trash can be an option, but it is heart-breaking since you are a book lover, and after all, the book might work out for someone else. If you knew someone interested in the book, you might gladly hand it over, but it is unlikely to find that person among your friends.

Solution:  
As a solution, our team suggests “My Little Bookstore,” a web application that aims to create a community by uploading the books they would like to sell and handing them over in person. People will also be able to view information about books provided by other users to help make the right choice. Our customers include anyone who loves or cares about books and those looking for specific second-hand books. We want to provide a variety of services to support their reading experience.
