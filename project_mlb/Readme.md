The source codes for the project are classified into two categories: front-end and back-end.  
Yet, the front-end components and the back-end server are not connected.  
To see or test our process, refer to the separate sets of instructions, each contained in the folder /frontend and /backend.  

For tracking ideas, enhancements, tasks, or, most importantly, bugs, we use Github Issues.
One can access Github Issues by simply clicking the Issues tab on the top of the repository page.
Checking and reporting bugs are supported.
