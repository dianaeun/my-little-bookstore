### Overview

The source codes for the project are classified into two categories: front-end and back-end.  

Previously in Milestone1, our frontend and backend server was not connected.

Now, the frontend is connected to our backend server; 'Fetch books', 'Add book', 'Delete book', 'Login', and 'Singup' functonalities can actually fetch or add data by accessing our MongoDB.

To explore our application, you should enter both frontend and backend folders and command 'npm start' separately.


### In a terminal
```
cd frontend
npm start
```

### In another terminal
```
cd backend
npm start
```




For tracking ideas, enhancements, tasks, or, most importantly, bugs, we use Github Issues.  
One can access Github Issues by simply clicking the Issues tab on the top of the repository page.  
Checking and reporting bugs are supported.

**We assume that you operate the both the front-end and back-end components of our application on MacOS or Windows.**
